Assignment 3b:

The following assigment we developed code that works along side with the parser.ml file we created earlier. The
code that we created is contained within the interpret functions. The AST functions input a parse tree and convert it
to a AST. The interpret functions then follow to recursively walk up the tree and give valid output to the ECL code.
The code written has error checking for various errors like but not limited to: non-numeric literal, unexpected end of input
etc.
