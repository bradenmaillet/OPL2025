Description:

Our group implemented the ability to translate a parse tree into an abstract syntax tree. It does this through the ast_ize_* functions. These can be called with parse tree input and will output a corresponding abstract syntax tree. Each ast_ize_* function works on particular parts of the ECL(extended calculator Language) grammar. IE ast_ize_e converts a parse tree expression into an abstract syntax tree expression.
